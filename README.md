# Sine wave speech

Convert recordings to sine wave speech in Python.
Sine wave speech is a method of converting speech to sounds that are utterly unintelligible on the first listen,
but with a little practice – hearing a few before-and-after examples – become easy to follow.
Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtTtKKAhyE) for an example.




The implementation is based on [Dan Ellis' code](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/resources/matlab/sws/), see `matlab/`.
