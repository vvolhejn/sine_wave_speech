1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,690
Do you hear these weird sci-fi sounds?

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,899
Surprise.

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,539
It's actually me, VÃ¡clav, speaking.

4
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,771
My voice is filtered using sine
wave speech, which is a technique

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,201
that radically simplifies the sound.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,090
When I speak, only four sine waves
are playing at any given time.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,570
A sine wave is the simplest
sound that you can make.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,880
Here's what a single one sounds like.

9
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:29,732
You can actually reproduce
any sound whatsoever using a

10
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:33,392
combination of sine waves at the
right frequencies and volumes.

11
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:37,292
You would need a lot more than
four to do that well, though.

12
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:41,912
With four waves, all you get
is this R2D2-like whistling.

13
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,659
You might be wondering what
my voice sounds like normally.

14
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:48,779
To find out, scroll to
the bottom of this page.

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,119
You can scroll up and down to
switch smoothly between the

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,009
processed and the original version.

17
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:58,141
The thing that fascinates me the
most about sine wave speech is the

18
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,591
fact that after a bit of practice
and hearing the same voice before

19
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,371
and after, you should be able to
make out what the person is saying.

20
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:09,671
And that's despite the fact that only
minutes earlier, you thought that

21
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,591
these were just nonsensical whistles.

22
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:14,824
If you want to check that you
really understand the sound.

23
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:16,894
Try not looking at the subtitles.

24
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,074
Here, I'll play this clip again.
[I actually won't, still need to implement that]

25
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:20,844
See, if you can understand it.
[I actually won't, still need to implement that]
