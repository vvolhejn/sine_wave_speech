1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,690
Do you hear these weird sci-fi sounds?

2
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:03,899
Surprise.

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,539
It's actually me, VÃ¡clav, speaking.

4
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,771
My voice is filtered using sine
wave speech, which is a technique

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,201
that radically simplifies the sound.

6
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:16,806
You might be wondering what
my voice sounds like normally.

7
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,926
To find out, scroll to
the bottom of this page.

8
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:24,852
When I speak, only four sine waves
are playing at any given time.

9
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:27,432
Here's what a single one sounds like.

10
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:33,284
You can actually reproduce
any sound whatsoever using a

11
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,944
combination of sine waves at the
right frequencies and volumes.

12
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:40,844
You would need a lot more than
four to do that well, though.

13
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:45,464
With four waves, all you get
is this R2D2-like whistling.

14
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:49,584
The thing that fascinates me the
most about sine wave speech is the

15
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:53,034
fact that after a bit of practice
and hearing the same voice before

16
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:56,814
and after, you should be able to
make out what the person is saying.

17
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,114
And that's despite the fact that only
minutes earlier, you thought that

18
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:03,034
these were just nonsensical whistles.

19
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:06,266
If you want to check that you
really understand the sound.

20
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:08,336
Try not looking at the subtitles.

21
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:10,516
Here, I'll play this clip again.

22
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,286
See, if you can understand it.
